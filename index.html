            <h2>1. Problem Space and Findings</h2>
            <p><strong>Project Overview:</strong></p>
            <p>For our course project, we focused on the design and optimization of a smart city layout, with a primary emphasis on unemployment rate monitoring and job distribution. The problem space emerged from the challenge of managing urban unemployment and ensuring equitable access to job opportunities in a data-driven city environment. We arrived at this problem space by analyzing issues such as high unemployment rates in certain regions and the lack of efficient systems for distributing job opportunities.</p>
            <p>Inspired by the increasing adoption of smart city technologies like IoT sensors, data analytics, and AI, we developed a system that integrates job distribution and unemployment monitoring within the city’s infrastructure. The system uses graph-based routing, job-matching algorithms, and predictive models to connect individuals with appropriate job opportunities. By applying these algorithms, we aim to improve job access and reduce unemployment disparities across different regions of the city.</p>
            <p>Our research, based on white papers and case studies, highlighted how smart cities leverage technology to collect and analyze data for decision-making, especially in areas like urban planning and economic development. These insights guided our approach in creating a solution that addresses both the economic and operational challenges cities face in managing job markets.</p>

            <h2>2. Problem Definition and Team Details</h2>
            <p><strong>Problem Definition:</strong></p>
            <p>This system addresses economic inequality by analysing unemployment data, monitoring job availability, and optimizing job distribution. The goal is to reduce unemployment rates and ensure fair job allocation based on skills, location, and industry demands.</p>
            <p>The project focuses on improving the employment rate and ensuring fair job distribution across the city. The system will:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Monitor unemployment in various districts.</li>
                <li>Match job seekers to jobs based on profiles and market demand.</li>
                <li>Predict and recommend policies for future unemployment trends.</li>
            </ul>
